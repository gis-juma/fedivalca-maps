# [FEDIVALCA webmapping portfolio](https://gis-juma.github.io/fedivalca-maps)

FEDIVALCA webmapping portfolio is a web page, responsive, based on a [Leaflet](http:leafletjs.com//) (Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps). 

The template was created by [jfolivarl](https://github.com/jfolivarl) for the maps of [FEDIVALCA](https://www.fedivalca.org/) organization. The template contains multiple sections with a off-canvas navigation menu created with HTML, CSS and JS (HTML is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. CSS is a style language for controlling the design and presentation of HTML elements, like color and layout. JavaScript is a high-level programming language for making web pages interactive and dynamic, allowing manipulation of HTML and CSS content, user interaction, and event-based actions).
